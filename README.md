🌐 Infrastructure as Code Portfolio

This repository showcases some demos for my personal practice with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates, focusing primarily on Terraform while also including projects using ARM templates and Bicep. The goal is to public document my learn path by design and automate deployments across Azure and AWS, following cloud best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability.

Most of the templates here will be built with Terraform, reflecting real-world infrastructure patterns and services. Upcoming projects will progressively expand into more advanced deployments across both cloud platforms.

📌 Planned Projects

☁️ Azure

⚡ Serverless Function App
Deploy a Consumption Function app running on Windows with some http trigger and basic operations with a Storage Account.

🖥️ Linux Virtual Machine

Deploy a Linux VM with Virtual Network, Subnet, and Public IP and also configured backups with Azure Recovery Service Vault!  

⚡ Elastic Premium Function App

Deploy a Function App with Service Bus and HTTP trigger.

Integrate with a VNet and secure the Storage Account with Private Endpoints.

📦 Container App

Deploy a Container App connected to Azure Container Registry.

Enable ingress for external access.

🐍 AKS + Flask Python App

Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

Run a sample Flask application in the cluster.

🔧 App Service with Jenkins

Deploy an App Service running Jenkins.

Document both IaC deployment steps and code deployment pipeline.

🌐 App Service with CI/CD (Azure DevOps)

Deploy an App Service configured with a full CI/CD pipeline.

Cover both infrastructure provisioning and code deployment stages.

☁️ AWS

⚡ Lambda Function with S3 Integration

Deploy a Lambda function using Terraform with VoP (Versioning on Package) configuration.

Configure an S3 Bucket to trigger on write operations.

🖥️ Linux EC2 Instance

Deploy an EC2 instance with networking configuration, backup settings, and IAM role management.

⚙️ Ansible on EC2
Use Ansible to configure an EC2 instance (install Nginx, deploy a Python web app).
Use Ansible to configure an EC2 instance.

Install Nginx and deploy a Python web application automatically.

✨ This portfolio is designed to evolve over time, adding new projects and refining existing ones, to highlight my ability to work with multi-cloud environments and apply DevOps/IaC practices effectively.
